# Market_Positioning_of_Mobile
This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating the selling price of mobile phones based on their features. With the fierce competition in the mobile industry, the CEO of a new mobile company seeks to gain insight into the pricing strategies employed by established players like Apple and Samsung. To achieve this, sales data from various companies are collected and analyzed. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to uncover relationships between mobile features (e.g., RAM, internal memory) and selling prices. By leveraging this predictive model, the CEO can make informed decisions regarding pricing strategies, enabling the company to compete effectively in the market. The code and documentation for this project are hosted on GitHub, providing transparency and accessibility to stakeholders and collaborators.
